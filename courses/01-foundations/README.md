# IoT Foundations

## Overview
This course is designed to provide the foundational knowledge required to understand IoT systems, networking, and embedded systems. You will learn the core concepts and get hands-on experience with basic IoT devices.

### Duration: 3 months

## Topics Covered
- **Introduction to IoT**:
  - What is IoT?
  - IoT Architecture: Sensors, Actuators, Devices, Gateways, Cloud.
  - Real-world IoT applications: Smart cities, healthcare, industrial IoT.
  
- **Networking Basics**:
  - IP addressing, MAC addresses, routers, switches.
  - Networking protocols: TCP/IP, UDP, HTTP, MQTT.
  - Introduction to wireless communication: Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee.
