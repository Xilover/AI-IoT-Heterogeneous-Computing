# AI-IoT-Heterogeneous-Computing

Welcome to the **AI-IoT-Heterogeneous-Computing** repository, your comprehensive learning portal and action-driven guide for mastering Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and Heterogeneous Computing.

This repository is structured into three main sections: **Learning Portal**, **Action in AI**, **Action in IoT**, and **Action in Heterogeneous Computing**. Each section provides resources, tutorials, and practical examples to get hands-on with these technologies.

## 1. Learning Portal

The **Learning Portal** serves as the foundational guide for understanding AI, IoT, and Heterogeneous Computing. Here, youâ€™ll find educational resources, reference materials, and tutorials to help you build a strong conceptual understanding.

### Topics Covered:
- **Introduction to AI**: Concepts like neural networks, machine learning algorithms, and deep learning.
- **Introduction to IoT**: Overview of IoT systems, devices, and communication protocols.
- **Introduction to Heterogeneous Computing**: Understanding how different processors (CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, TPUs) work together for optimized performance.

### Resources:
- Beginner to advanced tutorials.
- Videos and lectures.
- Open-source books and papers.
- Links to relevant research materials and documentation.

## 2. Action in AI

In the **Action in AI** section, you will dive into practical projects and applications of AI. This section is all about getting your hands dirty and learning by doing.

### Features:
- **AI-based Projects**: Pre-built project examples focusing on AI-powered applications.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Build and train ML models using Python, TensorFlow, and PyTorch.
- **Deep Learning Projects**: Experiment with CNNs, RNNs, and Transformers for image, video, and text processing.
- **AI Applications**: Real-world examples like AI for healthcare, smart home systems, predictive maintenance, and more.

### Example Project:
```bash
AI-Image-Classification/
â”œâ”€â”€ dataset/
â”œâ”€â”€ model.py
â”œâ”€â”€ train.py
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```
- **Instructions**: Each project comes with step-by-step instructions to set up, run, and modify the AI models.

## 3. Action in IoT

The **Action in IoT** section focuses on building real-world IoT applications, connecting sensors, and devices to the cloud and enabling edge computing.

### Features:
- **IoT Device Setup**: Guides on setting up popular IoT platforms like Raspberry Pi, ESP32, and STM32.
- **IoT Projects**: Hands-on projects like smart home automation, industrial IoT, and environmental monitoring.
- **Cloud Integration**: Tutorials on connecting IoT devices to cloud platforms like AWS IoT, Azure IoT Hub, and Google IoT Core.
- **Edge AI**: Implement edge computing with AI on devices using TensorFlow Lite, OpenCV, and more.

### Example Project:
```bash
Smart-Home-Automation/
â”œâ”€â”€ sensors/
â”œâ”€â”€ actuators/
â”œâ”€â”€ cloud-integration/
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```
- **Instructions**: Detailed instructions for connecting, configuring, and running IoT devices.

## 4. Action in Heterogeneous Computing

In this section, we take action in **Heterogeneous Computing**, leveraging the power of diverse hardware architectures like CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and TPUs for maximum performance.

### Features:
- **Programming with Heterogeneous Architectures**: Learn how to program for GPUs (CUDA), FPGAs (VHDL/Verilog), and TPUs.
- **Multi-Processor Integration**: Projects showing how to integrate multiple processors for a single application.
- **AI Acceleration**: Accelerate machine learning tasks using heterogeneous hardware setups.
- **Edge AI with Heterogeneous Computing**: Combining IoT and AI with different architectures at the edge.

### Example Project:
```bash
Heterogeneous-ML-Training/
â”œâ”€â”€ gpu-accelerated/
â”œâ”€â”€ fpga-integration/
â”œâ”€â”€ cpu-offloading/
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```
- **Instructions**: Includes code and guides for optimizing performance across different hardware types.
