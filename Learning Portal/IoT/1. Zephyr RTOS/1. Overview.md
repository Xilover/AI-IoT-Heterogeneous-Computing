### Lesson 1 â€“ Zephyr RTOS: Beyond the Basics

#### **Overview**

In this lesson, we will explore **thread management** and **data passing** in the **nRF Connect SDK/Zephyr RTOS**, focusing on the two main execution contexts: **Thread Context** and **Interrupt Context**. These contexts differ in usage and timing, and understanding them is essential for designing efficient, real-time applications.

We will first examine various **execution primitives** such as threads, interrupts, and how they coexist. We will then study the **life cycle of a thread**, exploring how the **Zephyr scheduler** manages task execution. Finally, we will cover common **data-passing techniques** like **message queues** and **FIFOs** for inter-thread communication.

By the end of this lesson, you will have a solid understanding of scheduling tasks, handling time constraints, and passing data between threads in a safe and efficient manner.

### **Objectives**

- **Understand Execution Options**: Learn the different execution contexts and how they handle **determinism** and **preemption**.
- **Comprehend Thread Life Cycle**: Gain a complete understanding of thread creation, scheduling, and termination.
- **Master Zephyr Kernel Options**: Explore how the Zephyr scheduler works to handle tasks with varying priorities and time constraints.
- **Subsystem and Network Stack Timing**: Understand how adding subsystems, network stacks, and other components impact application timing.
- **Schedule Application Tasks**: Learn to schedule tasks using the right **execution primitives** with appropriate priority levels.
- **Data Passing Between Threads**: Safely pass data between threads using **message queues** and **FIFOs**.
- **Hands-On Practice**: Create and manage different types of threads, and practice exchanging data between them using the techniques covered.

### **Key Concepts**

1. **Execution Contexts**:
   - **Thread Context**: Where most application logic runs, governed by priorities and the scheduler.
   - **Interrupt Context**: Reserved for handling high-priority, time-sensitive operations such as hardware events.
  
2. **Thread Life Cycle**:
   - Threads have states like **READY**, **RUNNING**, **SUSPENDED**, and **PENDING**, transitioning between them based on system events and scheduler decisions.

3. **Zephyr Scheduler**:
   - Responsible for determining which thread to run at any given time. The scheduler uses thread priority and timing to ensure tasks are executed in the right order.

4. **Message Queues and FIFOs**:
   - **Message Queues**: Allow structured data passing between threads, with strict control over message size and queue length.
   - **FIFOs**: Simpler data structures for passing data between threads, ensuring that items are handled in the order they are added.

### **Hands-On Practice**

1. **Creating and Managing Threads**:
   - Use `k_thread_create()` to create threads with different priorities and learn how the scheduler handles preemption and cooperative execution.

2. **Thread Synchronization**:
   - Practice synchronizing threads using **semaphores**, **mutexes**, and **condition variables** to avoid data races and ensure safe resource sharing.

3. **Data Passing Between Threads**:
   - Implement **message queues** and **FIFOs** to safely exchange data between threads. Test performance and reliability under various load conditions.

### **Expected Outcomes**

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Differentiate between thread and interrupt contexts and use them appropriately in your applications.
- Effectively schedule tasks using the right primitives based on timing constraints and priorities.
- Safely pass data between threads using message queues and FIFOs, ensuring robust inter-thread communication.
