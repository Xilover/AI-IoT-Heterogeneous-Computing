# Sensor Technologies and Data Acquisition

## Overview
This course focuses on understanding different sensor types and how to acquire data from them in IoT applications. You will learn how to interface sensors with microcontrollers and process sensor data.

### Duration: 3 months

## Topics Covered
- **Sensor Fundamentals**:
  - Analog vs. digital sensors.
  - Types of sensors: Temperature, humidity, pressure, proximity, motion.
  
- **Interfacing Sensors**:
  - Communication protocols: GPIO, I2C, SPI.
  - Connecting sensors to microcontrollers (Arduino, ESP32, STM32).
  - Reading data from sensors and visualizing it.

## Hands-on Projects
1. **Temperature and Humidity Monitoring System**:
   - Build a system to measure and display temperature and humidity using the DHT11 sensor.

2. **Smart Lighting System with Motion Sensors**:
   - Build an automated lighting system using a motion sensor and relay module.
