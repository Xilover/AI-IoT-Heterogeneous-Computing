# Communication Protocols for IoT

## Overview
This course teaches key communication protocols used in IoT systems. You'll learn about wireless technologies and IoT-specific communication protocols like MQTT and CoAP.

### Duration: 2 months

## Topics Covered
- **Wireless Communication Technologies**:
  - Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, BLE, Zigbee, LoRaWAN, NB-IoT.
  - Use cases and limitations of each protocol.
  
- **IoT-Specific Protocols**:
  - MQTT, CoAP, HTTP/HTTPS.
  - Protocol selection based on application requirements.

## Hands-on Projects
1. **MQTT-based IoT Device**:
   - Set up an IoT device that sends sensor data to the cloud using the MQTT protocol.

2. **Zigbee-based Home Automation System**:
   - Create a basic home automation system using Zigbee for device communication.
