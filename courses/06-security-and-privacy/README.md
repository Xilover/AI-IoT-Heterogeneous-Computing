# IoT Security and Privacy

## Overview
This course covers IoT security best practices, including encryption, secure communication, and device authentication. You'll also learn about privacy concerns and how to implement privacy-by-design in IoT systems.

### Duration: 2 months

## Topics Covered
- **IoT Security Challenges**:
  - Common vulnerabilities: Weak authentication, insecure firmware, network attacks.
  - Security risks in IoT ecosystems.
  
- **Best Practices for IoT Security**:
  - Encryption and secure communication protocols (TLS, HTTPS).
  - Device authentication and access control.
  - Secure firmware updates and patch management.

- **IoT Privacy**:
  - Privacy concerns with data collection.
  - Implementing user data protection and privacy-by-design.

## Hands-on Projects
1. **End-to-End Encryption**:
   - Secure an IoT deviceâ€™s communication with end-to-end encryption using TLS.

2. **Device Authentication using OAuth2**:
   - Implement authentication for IoT devices using OAuth2.
