### Module 8: Security and eMMC

---

#### **8.1 Secure eMMC Functions**

**Objective**: Understand the built-in security features of eMMC chips and how to use them to protect sensitive data.

- **Secure Erase**:
  - This function allows you to completely erase data from the eMMC. Unlike a standard erase, secure erase ensures that data cannot be recovered by overwriting the blocks with zeros or a predefined pattern.
  - **Use Case**: Ideal for scenarios where the eMMC chip is being reused or decommissioned, ensuring no sensitive data can be retrieved.

  **Practical Command**:
  - On Linux, use `mmc-utils` to perform a secure erase on the eMMC.
  
  ```bash
  mmc erase secure 0x0 0x10000 /dev/mmcblk0
  ```

  This command erases a range of blocks (from `0x0` to `0x10000` in this case) and ensures they are securely wiped.

- **Trim**:
  - The trim command informs the eMMC which blocks are no longer in use. It helps with optimizing the eMMC’s performance and lifespan by allowing the controller to manage free space more effectively.
  - **Use Case**: Regularly issuing trim commands in systems with frequent data deletion helps maintain performance.

  **Practical Command**:
  - Use `fstrim` on Linux to issue a trim command across the filesystem.

  ```bash
  fstrim /mnt/data_partition
  ```

- **Secure Boot**:
  - **Secure Boot** ensures that only authenticated firmware can boot from the eMMC chip. This is achieved by cryptographically signing the firmware and validating the signature during the boot process.
  - **Use Case**: Secure boot is crucial in protecting the system from unauthorized firmware or bootloader modifications.

  **Practical Steps**:
  - Generate a key pair (private key to sign, public key to verify).
  - Sign the firmware with the private key.
  - Store the public key in the eMMC’s boot partition or secure storage.
  - Modify the bootloader to check the signature before booting the firmware.

#### **8.2 Practical Lab: Implementing Secure Boot and Secure Erase on eMMC**

**Objective**: Implement and test secure boot and secure erase functionalities on an embedded system using eMMC.

---

**Step-by-Step Lab Exercise**:

1. **Set Up Secure Boot**:
   - **Key Generation**: Use tools like OpenSSL to generate a key pair for signing the bootloader.
   
   ```bash
   openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private_key.pem
   openssl rsa -in private_key.pem -pubout -out public_key.pem
   ```

   - **Sign the Bootloader**: Sign your bootloader or kernel with the private key.
   
   ```bash
   openssl dgst -sha256 -sign private_key.pem -out signed_boot.bin bootloader.bin
   ```

   - **Modify Bootloader**: Ensure the bootloader has secure boot enabled and is capable of verifying the signed bootloader before loading it. This step may vary based on the bootloader you're using (e.g., U-Boot or a custom bootloader).
   - **Store the Public Key**: Place the public key on a secure partition or integrate it into the bootloader itself for signature verification.

2. **Test Secure Boot**:
   - Reboot the system and attempt to load the signed bootloader.
   - Verify that the bootloader only loads if the signature matches the public key.
   - Try loading an unsigned or tampered bootloader, and ensure it is rejected.

3. **Perform a Secure Erase**:
   - Use `mmc-utils` to securely erase specific blocks on the eMMC chip. In this example, you will erase the user data partition.
   
   ```bash
   mmc erase secure 0x10000 0x20000 /dev/mmcblk0
   ```

   - After the secure erase, attempt to read from the erased area to verify that the data is completely wiped.
   
   ```bash
   hexdump /dev/mmcblk0 | grep "0000"
   ```

4. **Issue a Trim Command**:
   - Perform a trim operation on the data partition to free up unused blocks and optimize the eMMC’s performance.
   
   ```bash
   fstrim /mnt/data_partition
   ```

   - Measure the performance before and after the trim operation using read/write tests to see the effect of the trim.

#### **8.3 Ransomware-Resistant Architectures Using eMMC**

**Objective**: Learn how to protect an embedded system using eMMC from ransomware attacks by leveraging secure storage and backup strategies.

- **Immutable Partitions**:
  - Mark critical partitions as read-only or immutable to prevent unauthorized changes.
  - **Use Case**: Protect bootloaders, firmware, and system-critical data from being encrypted or modified by ransomware.

  **Practical Steps**:
  - Use `chattr +i` to set the immutable attribute on important files or partitions.
  
  ```bash
  chattr +i /boot/bootloader.bin
  ```

- **Ransomware Detection**:
  - Implement real-time monitoring to detect abnormal file access patterns. If ransomware-like behavior is detected, the system can trigger a rollback or restore mechanism.
  - Use tools like **inotify** on Linux to monitor for suspicious file operations (e.g., mass encryption of files).

- **Secure Backups**:
  - Store backups in a dedicated, secure partition on the eMMC chip that can be restored in case of a ransomware attack.
  - **Practical Approach**: Use periodic backups to ensure critical data can be recovered if ransomware encrypts the primary partition.
