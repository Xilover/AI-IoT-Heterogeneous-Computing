### Module 4: Data Recovery and Testing

---

#### **4.1 eMMC Data Recovery Techniques**

**Objective**: Learn techniques for recovering data from malfunctioning or damaged eMMC chips.

- **Common Causes of Data Loss**:
  - Bad sectors or blocks.
  - Incorrect firmware or driver issues.
  - Electrical damage or improper power cycling.
  
- **Data Recovery Tools**:
  - **eMMC Programmers**: Devices like the **Easy JTAG** or **Medusa Pro Box** allow direct access to the eMMC chip, bypassing the system it's embedded in.
  - **JTAG/ISP (In-System Programming)**: JTAG tools provide a way to read from and write to eMMC chips using standard protocols.
  
- **eMMC Pinout for Data Extraction**:
  - You’ll need to access specific pins on the eMMC for programming or data recovery:
    - **CMD**: Command line for communication.
    - **DAT0-DAT7**: Data lines for read/write operations.
    - **CLK**: Clock line for synchronization.
    - **VCC**: Power supply pin for the eMMC chip.
  
  Use the BGA 153 pinout chart to identify the appropriate connections.

#### **4.2 Testing eMMC Chips**

**Objective**: Learn how to test the health and performance of eMMC chips using software tools and testing methodologies.

- **Software Tools**:
  - **mmc-utils**: A Linux-based utility that allows you to communicate with and test the functionality of an eMMC chip.
  - **H2testw (Windows)**: A tool for verifying the integrity and performance of flash storage, including eMMC.

- **Key Health Metrics**:
  - **Read/Write Speed**: Measure the speed at which data can be written to and read from the eMMC.
  - **Bad Block Count**: The number of bad blocks can indicate wear or damage to the eMMC.
  - **Wear Leveling Efficiency**: eMMC uses wear leveling algorithms to distribute writes evenly across the memory cells, extending the chip's life.
  
- **Testing Workflow**:
  1. **Identify eMMC on Linux**:
     - Use `lsblk` to identify the eMMC device.
     - Install `mmc-utils` via package manager (`apt` or `yum`) on Linux.
  
  2. **Check Status**:
     - Run `mmc extcsd read /dev/mmcblk0` to read the extended CSD register, which provides vital information about the eMMC chip, such as its capacity, partitioning information, and device status.
  
  3. **Perform a Health Check**:
     - Run a read/write test using the tool to check for bad blocks and ensure the read/write speed meets the manufacturer’s specifications.
  
  4. **Check Partition and Boot Configuration**:
     - Use `mmc-utils` to inspect or change the partition configuration, as eMMC can have separate boot and user data partitions.

#### **4.3 Practical Lab: Extracting Data from a Damaged eMMC**

**Objective**: Apply data recovery techniques to extract data from a damaged or malfunctioning eMMC chip.

---

**Step-by-Step Lab Exercise**:

1. **Set Up the eMMC Programmer**:
   - Connect the eMMC chip to a programmer like Easy JTAG or Medusa Pro Box.
   - Use the pinout of the BGA 153 package to make the necessary connections to the programmer.

2. **Connect to the Programmer Software**:
   - Launch the JTAG programmer software on your PC and choose the appropriate eMMC model from the list of supported chips.

3. **Read the Chip**:
   - Use the programmer to read the entire eMMC chip. Save the read data as a binary image file for analysis.
   
4. **Verify the Data**:
   - After reading the data, verify its integrity by comparing the expected values in critical sections (such as boot partitions) with the read data.
   
5. **Recover Files**:
   - If the data is readable, use file recovery software to extract individual files from the eMMC image, or manually search for file signatures in the binary data.

6. **Handling Bad Blocks**:
   - If bad blocks are detected, some tools allow you to retry reading from those blocks multiple times. Mark the bad blocks in the recovered image to avoid further data corruption.
