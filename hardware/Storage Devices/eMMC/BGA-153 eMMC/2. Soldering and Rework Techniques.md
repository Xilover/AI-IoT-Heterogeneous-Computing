### Module 2: Soldering and Rework Techniques

---

#### **2.1 Soldering Basics for BGA Packages**

**Objective**: Learn the fundamentals of soldering BGA (Ball Grid Array) packages, specifically the BGA 153 eMMC chip.

- **Required Equipment**:
  - **Reflow Oven or Hot Air Rework Station**: Used to heat the solder balls on the BGA package for soldering onto the PCB.
  - **Soldering Iron with Fine Tip**: For any manual soldering adjustments around the chip.
  - **BGA Stencils**: Helps apply solder paste evenly to the PCB pads.
  - **Flux**: Improves the wetting of the solder and prevents oxidation during the reflow process.
  - **Microscope or Magnifying Glass**: For detailed inspection during the soldering process.
  
- **Key Soldering Steps**:
  1. **Preparation**:
     - Apply a thin layer of solder paste to the PCB pads where the eMMC chip will be placed. You can use a BGA stencil to ensure precise application.
  2. **Chip Placement**:
     - Align the eMMC chip over the PCB pads. Proper alignment is crucial to ensure all 153 balls make good contact with their respective pads.
  3. **Reflow**:
     - Use a reflow oven or hot air station to heat the chip until the solder melts and creates a solid connection. The typical reflow temperature is around 230-260°C, depending on the solder paste used.
  4. **Cooling**:
     - Allow the PCB to cool down gradually. Sudden temperature changes can create stress and damage the solder joints.

- **Best Practices**:
  - **Ensure Proper Alignment**: Use visual aids or alignment tools to ensure the chip is precisely positioned.
  - **Inspect for Bridges**: Look for solder bridges between adjacent balls, which can cause short circuits.
  - **Clean the Area**: After soldering, clean the area with isopropyl alcohol to remove flux residue.

#### **2.2 Rework Techniques**

**Objective**: Master the techniques required to remove and re-solder eMMC chips when issues arise during or after installation.

- **Desoldering the eMMC**:
  - **Hot Air Rework Station**: Apply heat uniformly to the BGA package using a hot air station to melt the solder balls underneath. Use tweezers to lift the chip carefully once the solder melts.
  - **Solder Wick or Desoldering Pump**: After removing the chip, use a solder wick to clean the PCB pads of any residual solder. This prepares the area for reinstallation.
  
- **Reballing**:
  - In some cases, the eMMC chip may need to be re-balled before re-soldering. Use a **reballing stencil** to apply new solder balls to the chip.

- **Inspecting the Rework**:
  - **X-ray Inspection**: Ideal for ensuring all solder balls are correctly connected, especially since the connections are hidden under the chip.
  - **Microscope Inspection**: Use a microscope to visually inspect the surface and ensure there are no visible defects.

- **Common Issues During Rework**:
  - **Solder Bridges**: Occurs when too much solder connects adjacent balls, causing short circuits.
  - **Cold Solder Joints**: These are weak solder joints that can break easily due to insufficient heating or poor flux application.

#### **2.3 Practical Lab: Soldering a BGA 153 eMMC Chip**

**Objective**: Apply the skills learned to solder and inspect a BGA 153 eMMC chip on a development board.

- **Step-by-Step Lab Exercise**:
  1. **Prepare the PCB**: Apply solder paste to the PCB using a BGA stencil. Ensure a clean, even layer across all pads.
  2. **Place the eMMC Chip**: Carefully align the BGA 153 eMMC chip over the solder paste. Use an alignment tool if needed.
  3. **Reflow the Chip**: Use a reflow oven or hot air rework station to solder the chip onto the PCB.
  4. **Inspection**:
     - **Microscope Inspection**: Use a microscope to check for any visual issues like solder bridges or poor alignment.
     - **Electrical Testing**: Verify connections by powering the board and testing basic communication with the eMMC.
  5. **Rework if Needed**: If any issues are found, practice removing the chip and re-soldering it using the techniques covered in this module.
