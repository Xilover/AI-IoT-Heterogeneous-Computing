### **Boot-up Sequence & Execution Context in Zephyr RTOS**

#### **1. Boot-up Sequence Overview**

Understanding the boot-up sequence is essential for selecting the correct execution context and scheduling tasks effectively. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key stages in the nRF Connect SDK/Zephyr boot-up process:

---

#### **1.1 Early Boot Sequence (C Code Preparation)**
- This stage transitions the system from its reset state to one capable of executing C code.
- The kernel initialization sequence begins here, but this phase is standard and not of significant concern to the application developer.

---

#### **1.2 Kernel Initialization**
- **Static devices** are initialized during this phase, based on application and board configuration files (e.g., `prj.conf`).
- Device initialization is controlled by **run levels**, such as `PRE_KERNEL_1` and `PRE_KERNEL_2`, which ensure correct order and priority.
- **Kernel services** are not available during this stage, so these initializations do not rely on the scheduler.

##### **PRE_KERNEL_1 Initialization (Minimal Core)**
- **Clock Control Driver**: Powers other subsystems and ensures power efficiency through clock control.
- **Serial Driver**: Handles debugging output (UART, RTT), initialized only if debugging is enabled.

##### **PRE_KERNEL_2 Initialization (Core Timing Services)**
- **System Timer Driver**: Uses a real-time counter peripheral (e.g., RTC1) on Nordic SoCs. It manages timing services like `k_sleep()` and kernel timer APIs.

---

#### **1.3 Multithreading Preparation**
- During this phase, multithreading features (e.g., the **scheduler**) are initialized, and **system threads** are created:
  - **Main thread**: Responsible for application initialization.
  - **Idle thread**: Manages power when no other threads are ready.
- **POST_KERNEL** services are initialized (if any), followed by the Zephyr boot banner, indicating the RTOS is fully initialized.
- **Application-defined threads** are created using `K_THREAD_DEFINE()`.

##### **POST_KERNEL Initialization**
- Services requiring kernel functions (e.g., logging, Bluetooth) are initialized here. For instance:
  - **Logger** (if enabled) initializes its own thread for deferred logging.
  - **Bluetooth Stack** initializes its **RX** and **TX** threads.

##### **APPLICATION Level Initialization**
- If certain libraries (e.g., **AT_MONITOR** on nRF91) are used, they initialize here.
- The **RTOS main thread** becomes the active thread, executing `main()` or terminating if no `main()` is provided. The scheduler then selects the next ready thread.

### **2. Thread Context vs Interrupt Context**

When developing with the nRF Connect SDK/Zephyr RTOS, understanding the differences between **thread** and **interrupt** contexts helps ensure tasks are scheduled and executed appropriately.

---

#### **2.1 Thread Context**

- **Execution**: Normal application and system threads run here.
- **Trigger**: Threads are created by the application/RTOS and scheduled based on type and priority.
- **Preemption**: Threads can be preempted by higher-priority threads or interrupts.
- **Duration**: Threads can run longer and handle more complex operations than interrupt handlers.

**Allowed Operations**:
- Access to full kernel services.
- Time-consuming operations.
- Blocking I/O operations.
- Waiting on synchronization primitives like **mutexes**, **semaphores**, or **event flags**.

**Not Allowed Operations**:
- Direct access to hardware registers without proper synchronization.
- Time-critical operations.

---

#### **2.2 Interrupt Context**

- **Execution**: This context refers to when interrupt handlers are running.
- **Trigger**: Triggered asynchronously by hardware events (e.g., timers, external signals).
- **Preemption**: Interrupts preempt threads and can nest if of higher priority.
- **Duration**: Interrupts are designed to be brief to avoid delaying system threads.

**Allowed Operations**:
- Time-critical operations.
- Limited access to kernel services (e.g., `k_timer`).

**Not Allowed Operations**:
- Blocking operations.
- Most kernel services for thread contexts (e.g., sleeping, waiting on mutexes).

---

### **3. Conclusion: Choosing the Right Execution Primitive**

When designing tasks for your application, it is crucial to select the proper execution primitive (thread, interrupt, work queue) based on:
- **Priority**: Ensure the priority is set correctly to avoid blocking critical tasks.
- **Execution Time**: Use interrupts for quick, time-sensitive tasks and threads for longer, more complex operations.
- **Kernel Services**: Avoid using blocking services within an interrupt context.

Understanding the boot-up sequence and the differences between thread and interrupt contexts will help you make informed decisions about task scheduling and execution in Zephyr RTOS applications.
