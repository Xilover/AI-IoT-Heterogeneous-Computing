# Edge Computing and AI Integration

## Overview
In this course, you'll learn how to process data at the edge of IoT networks, reducing latency and bandwidth usage. You will also integrate AI models into IoT devices to make real-time decisions at the edge.

### Duration: 3 months

## Topics Covered
- **Introduction to Edge Computing**:
  - What is edge computing, and why is it important?
  - Benefits: Reduced latency, lower bandwidth usage.

- **Edge AI**:
  - Running AI/ML models on IoT devices (TinyML).
  - Tools: TensorFlow Lite, Edge Impulse, OpenVINO.

## Hands-on Projects
1. **AI-based Image Recognition System**:
   - Implement an image recognition system on a Raspberry Pi using TensorFlow Lite.

2. **Anomaly Detection with Edge AI**:
   - Set up an IoT device to detect anomalies in sensor data using machine learning models at the edge.
