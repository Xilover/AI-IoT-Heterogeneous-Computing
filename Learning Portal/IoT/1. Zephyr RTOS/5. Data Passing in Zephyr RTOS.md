### **Data Passing in Zephyr RTOS**

In the nRF Connect SDK/Zephyr RTOS, **message queues** and **FIFOs** are two common mechanisms used for safely exchanging data between threads and ISRs. These mechanisms ensure that multiple threads can access shared data without running into race conditions, thus enabling efficient communication between different parts of an application.

### **Message Queue**

A **message queue** is a kernel object that allows threads to pass fixed-size messages in a **thread-safe** manner. The queue can store various types of data, including integers, structs, or pointers. The kernel manages the internal mechanisms of the queue, ensuring safe and efficient operations for both sending and receiving data.

#### **How Message Queues Work:**
- **Thread-Safe:** Multiple threads can safely access the queue simultaneously.
- **Fixed Size:** The message queue holds a fixed number of elements (messages) defined at compile time.
- **Timeout Support:** Threads can block, wait, or drop messages based on queue availability.

#### **Steps to Use a Message Queue:**

1. **Define the Data Type:**
   - Define the type of message you will store in the queue (e.g., integers, structs, unions).
   ```c
   struct MyStruct {
     int dataType; 
     union {
       int intValue;
       float floatValue;
       char stringValue[24];
     } data;
   };
   ```

2. **Define and Initialize the Message Queue:**
   - Use `K_MSGQ_DEFINE()` to declare the queue with parameters for element size, queue length, and alignment.
   ```c
   K_MSGQ_DEFINE(device_message_queue, sizeof(uint32_t), 16, 4);
   ```

3. **Writing to the Queue:**
   - Use `k_msgq_put()` to add a message to the queue.
   ```c
   uint32_t message = 100;
   k_msgq_put(&device_message_queue, &message, K_NO_WAIT);
   ```

4. **Reading from the Queue:**
   - Use `k_msgq_get()` to remove and retrieve a message from the queue.
   ```c
   uint32_t received_message;
   k_msgq_get(&device_message_queue, &received_message, K_FOREVER);
   ```

#### **Use Cases:**
- Ideal for **asynchronous** data passing between threads of **known size and number**.
- Safe for use with **interrupts**, but timeouts (e.g., `K_FOREVER`) should be avoided in ISR contexts.

### **FIFO (First In, First Out)**

A **FIFO** is a kernel object that functions as a queue in which data is added and removed in a **first-in, first-out** manner. Unlike a message queue, FIFO can hold data of **varying sizes** and numbers, making it more flexible. FIFO primarily holds **addresses** of data items rather than the data itself, which is typically stored in **heap memory**.

#### **How FIFO Works:**
- **Dynamic Size:** The number of items is dynamically allocated, based on heap size.
- **Flexible Data Size:** The data items can vary in size.
- **Heap Usage:** Memory is allocated and freed dynamically using the heap.

#### **Steps to Use a FIFO:**

1. **Define the Data Type:**
   - Define a struct where the first member is a reserved void pointer for FIFO's internal linked list.
   ```c
   struct data_item_t {
     void *fifo_reserved;
     uint8_t data[256];
     uint16_t len;
   };
   ```

2. **Define the FIFO:**
   - Use `K_FIFO_DEFINE()` to declare the FIFO.
   ```c
   K_FIFO_DEFINE(my_fifo);
   ```

3. **Add an Item to the FIFO:**
   - Allocate memory for the data item and add it to the FIFO using `k_fifo_put()`.
   ```c
   struct data_item_t *buf = k_malloc(sizeof(struct data_item_t));
   k_fifo_put(&my_fifo, buf);
   ```

4. **Read an Item from the FIFO:**
   - Use `k_fifo_get()` to retrieve and remove a data item from the FIFO.
   ```c
   struct data_item_t *rec_item = k_fifo_get(&my_fifo, K_FOREVER);
   k_free(rec_item);
   ```

#### **Use Cases:**
- Useful for **asynchronous** data transfer between threads where data items are of **varying sizes** and **dynamically allocated**.
- Can be used in **ISRs**, but dynamic memory management needs to be handled carefully.

### **Key Differences Between Message Queue and FIFO:**

| Feature              | **Message Queue**                           | **FIFO**                                     |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Size**             | Fixed number and size of items              | Dynamic number and size of items             |
| **Memory**           | Statically allocated                       | Typically uses dynamic (heap) memory         |
| **Data Type**        | Defined at compile time (fixed data type)   | Can vary at runtime                          |
| **Timeouts**         | Supports timeouts                          | No timeouts for adding data                  |
| **Use with ISRs**    | Safe, but avoid timeouts                    | Safe, but dynamic memory must be handled     |

### **Best Practices:**

1. **Message Queue**:
   - Use for transferring **fixed-size** data between threads.
   - Avoid **long blocking operations** or timeouts in ISRs.

2. **FIFO**:
   - Use for **variable-sized** data items that are allocated dynamically.
   - Free memory properly after consuming the data to avoid memory leaks.
   - Be cautious when using dynamic memory in embedded systems to prevent heap fragmentation or overflows.

Both **message queues** and **FIFOs** offer powerful mechanisms for **inter-thread communication** in Zephyr RTOS. Choosing between them depends on the **size**, **number**, and **dynamic nature** of the data you need to pass between threads and ISRs.
