### **Zephyr RTOS Scheduler In-Depth**

The scheduler in Zephyr RTOS plays a critical role in managing thread execution. It is responsible for selecting a thread from the **ready queue** to run on the CPU. Since Zephyr is a real-time operating system (RTOS), the scheduler prioritizes tasks based on thread priority, without considering fairness or execution history.

#### **Key Concepts of the Scheduler:**

---

### **1. Context Switching**

When a thread is preempted by the scheduler or interrupted by an interrupt service routine (ISR), the current **thread context** (CPU registers, stack, etc.) must be saved. This ensures that the thread can resume correctly once it is re-scheduled. Context switching involves:
- **Saving** the current state of the thread (registers, stack).
- **Restoring** the saved state when the thread is re-scheduled.

However, context switching introduces overhead, as it requires data copying. As a developer, minimizing the number of context switches is important to maintain performance.

### **2. Thread Types**

#### **2.1 Preemptable Threads**
- The most commonly used threads in Zephyr RTOS.
- **Preemptable** by higher-priority threads or interrupts.
- Good for general application tasks where preemption is acceptable.

#### **2.2 Cooperative Threads**
- Cannot be preempted by the scheduler.
- Run to completion unless they voluntarily yield or block (e.g., via `k_sleep()`, `k_yield()`).
- Often used for **scheduler locking** to prevent race conditions and mutual exclusion.

Cooperative threads are frequently used in subsystems, network stacks, and device drivers where scheduler control is crucial.

#### **2.3 Meta-IRQ Threads**
- Special type of cooperative thread used for handling urgent tasks after an ISR.
- Not intended for user applications but essential for device drivers that require post-ISR handling (e.g., Bluetooth stack handling).

### **3. Thread Priority**

Thread priority in Zephyr is assigned as a signed integer:
- **Non-negative priorities (0 and higher)** are assigned to **preemptable threads**.
- **Negative priorities** are assigned to **cooperative threads**.

Lower numerical values indicate **higher priority**. For example, a thread with priority `0` has a higher priority than a thread with priority `7`. Similarly, a cooperative thread with priority `-1` will have higher priority than a preemptable thread with priority `4`.

- The number of preemptable priorities can be configured using `CONFIG_NUM_PREEMPT_PRIORITIES` (default: 15).
- The number of cooperative priorities can be configured using `CONFIG_NUM_COOP_PRIORITIES` (default: 16).

### **4. Scheduler Locking and Disabling Interrupts**

#### **4.1 Scheduler Locking**
- **Cooperative threads** inherently lock the scheduler by default.
- **Preemptable threads** can temporarily lock the scheduler using `k_sched_lock()` to prevent preemption during critical sections. Unlocking the scheduler is done via `k_sched_unlock()`.

#### **4.2 Disabling Interrupts**
- To ensure a critical section is not preempted by both the scheduler and ISRs, you can use `irq_lock()` and `irq_unlock()` to fully disable interrupts.

---

### **5. Managing Threads with Equal Priority**

When multiple threads have the same priority, the scheduler needs a method to decide which one runs first. Zephyr offers several strategies for handling this:

#### **5.1 Default Behavior**
- The thread that was made **Ready** first is chosen to run.

#### **5.2 Time Slicing**
- Threads with equal priority share CPU time in slices. Once a threadâ€™s time slice expires, the scheduler preempts it and switches to the next thread with the same priority.
- Time slicing is enabled with the `CONFIG_TIMESLICING` Kconfig symbol.

#### **5.3 Earliest Deadline First (EDF) Scheduling**
- Threads are assigned deadlines. The scheduler runs the thread with the **earliest deadline**.
- This requires the developer to provide deadlines using `k_thread_deadline_set()`.

---

### **6. Rescheduling Points**

Zephyr uses a **tickless kernel** design to optimize power consumption. Instead of periodically interrupting the system to check for rescheduling, Zephyr triggers rescheduling at **specific points**, known as **rescheduling points**. These occur when:

- A thread **yields** via `k_yield()` or becomes **unready** (e.g., calls `k_sleep()`).
- A kernel synchronization object (e.g., **semaphore**, **mutex**) unblocks a waiting thread.
- **Time slicing** occurs and the time slice for a thread expires.
- A thread becomes ready after receiving data via kernel objects.

This approach reduces unnecessary CPU interruptions, leading to power savings.

### **Conclusion**

In Zephyr RTOS, understanding how the **scheduler** works, how to effectively manage **thread priorities**, and how to minimize **context switching** is key to building efficient real-time applications. By using the appropriate thread types and controlling priority levels, you can optimize task execution and system performance.
